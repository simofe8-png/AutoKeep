# AutoKeep — Current Status (resume pointer)

_Last updated: 2026-09-25_

## Position

- **Milestone:** M05 Local-first Persistence
- **Current task:** T043 (SQLite integration and migration framework)
- **Last verified PASS:** T042 — M04 PASS
- **Next action:** expo-sqlite + migration runner + Jest SQLite adapter

## Granted policies

- Local git commits at meaningful verified checkpoints (normally milestone PASS). No push. (User, 2026-09-25)
- Android verification on the user's physical phone through Expo Go. The user connects it when needed. (User, 2026-09-25)
- Proportional per-task verification, with the full suite at milestone gates. (User, 2026-09-25)

## Environment notes

- Node 24.16, npm 11.13, JDK 17, adb, Docker Desktop, gh are installed. The Supabase CLI is used through `npx supabase`.
- `ANDROID_HOME=C:\Android\Sdk` (no emulator); the full SDK is at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`.
- The project path contains Hebrew characters, so avoid local Gradle builds (ADR-0005).

## Open issues

- UI is FROZEN (ADR-0007, docs/ui-baseline). Backend work must feed the existing screens without redesign.
- Native-RTL release build must re-verify TextInput alignment and text rules (M24 T182).
- Device verification tooling: `tools/device-shots.sh`, `tools/adb-tap.py` (python + PIL available).

- expo-router `typedRoutes` disabled: its incremental generator registered non-route files as routes on this machine (stale .expo/types broke tsc). Revisit if upstream fixes it.

- Device: run Metro with `npm run start:device` (Node 24 localhost→::1 breaks Expo Go over adb reverse). Expo Go was installed on the user phone by Expo CLI (2026-09-25).
- `@types/jest` 30 vs expected 29.5 (expo install --check); harmless for now, align in M03.

- `npm audit`: 14 moderate advisories in the Expo template's transitive dependencies (dev tooling). Review in T166.

## Pending approval gates

- none

## Repository / checkpoint

- Checkpoint commits: `M00`–`M04` on `master` (local only, not pushed).

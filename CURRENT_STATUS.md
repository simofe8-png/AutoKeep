# AutoKeep — Current Status (resume pointer)

_Last updated: 2026-09-25_

## Position

- **Milestone:** M03 Visual Acceptance
- **Current task:** T031 (Android device rendering verification)
- **Last verified PASS:** T030 (M02 PASS)
- **Next action:** systematic device pass over all screens (screens list in task-plan T030 evidence)

## Granted policies

- Local git commits at meaningful verified checkpoints (normally milestone PASS). No push. (User, 2026-09-25)
- Android verification on the user's physical phone through Expo Go. The user connects it when needed. (User, 2026-09-25)
- Proportional per-task verification, with the full suite at milestone gates. (User, 2026-09-25)

## Environment notes

- Node 24.16, npm 11.13, JDK 17, adb, Docker Desktop, gh are installed. The Supabase CLI is used through `npx supabase`.
- `ANDROID_HOME=C:\Android\Sdk` (no emulator); the full SDK is at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`.
- The project path contains Hebrew characters, so avoid local Gradle builds (ADR-0005).

## Open issues

- expo-router `typedRoutes` disabled: its incremental generator registered non-route files as routes on this machine (stale .expo/types broke tsc). Revisit if upstream fixes it.

- Device: run Metro with `npm run start:device` (Node 24 localhost→::1 breaks Expo Go over adb reverse). Expo Go was installed on the user phone by Expo CLI (2026-09-25).
- `@types/jest` 30 vs expected 29.5 (expo install --check); harmless for now, align in M03.

- `npm audit`: 14 moderate advisories in the Expo template's transitive dependencies (dev tooling). Review in T166.

## Pending approval gates

- none

## Repository / checkpoint

- Checkpoint commits: `M00`, `M01`, `M02` on `master` (local only, not pushed).
